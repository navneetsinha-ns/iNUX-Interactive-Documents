# iNUX Interactive Documents

This repository hosts the **interactive digital learning materials** developed within the iNUX project. The materials are designed to support teaching and learning in hydrogeology, groundwater hydrology, and related fields through interactive, open-source resources.

The repository includes:
- Interactive applications implemented as **Streamlit apps**
- Executable **Jupyter Notebooks** for transparent and reproducible workflows
- Associated educational resources such as digital questions and supporting data

The interactive documents are intended for use in **self-learning, classroom teaching, online courses, and professional training**, and are continuously extended and refined.

## Interactive Documents Web Catalog

For an overview of all available interactive documents, including search and navigation functionality, please refer to the **iNUX Web Catalog**:

👉 **[iNUX Interactive Documents Web Catalog](https://gw-inux.github.io/iNUX-Interactive-Documents)**

The catalog provides:
- A structured overview of all interactive materials
- Direct links to deployed Streamlit applications and executable notebooks
- Metadata on topics, prerequisites, and intended use cases

It represents the recommended entry point for exploring and accessing the interactive documents hosted in this repository.

## Organization and Structure

The repository is organized according to the **iNUX categorization framework**, which provides a consistent thematic structure aligned with standard hydrogeology curricula and commonly used textbook concepts.

The categorization defines:
- Main thematic categories and subcategories
- A systematic numbering scheme for all resources
- A common reference system used across repositories, reports, and the web catalog

The full description of the categorization concept is documented in the iNUX Handbook:
