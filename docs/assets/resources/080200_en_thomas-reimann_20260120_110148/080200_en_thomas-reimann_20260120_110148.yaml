# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This app illustrates the numerical solution of the 1D groundwater flow equation for a confined aquifer using a finite-difference scheme. Users can interactively compare Jacobi, Gauss–Seidel, and SOR solvers, visualize the iterative path toward convergence, and evaluate results against the analytical solution. The tool supports conceptual understanding of solver behavior, convergence characteristics, and numerical accuracy in groundwater modeling.
